Binance Futures Testnet Trading Bot ðŸ¤–

This is a simplified Python trading bot that connects to the **Binance Futures Testnet**.  
It supports placing market, limit, and stop-limit orders, and has a clean Streamlit web UI to interact with everything in your browser.

I built this as part of a technical task for a Junior Python Developer role. It's modular, readable, and logs all actions.

Features

Market, Limit, and Stop-Limit order support (buy/sell)
Live price preview for trading pairs
Real-time USDT balance and open position display
View recent order history for each symbol
Streamlit-based frontend (no frontend coding needed)
Logs API calls and errors in `trading.log`
